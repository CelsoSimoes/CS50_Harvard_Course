# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project was entirely made and developed by me: Celso Junio Simoes

In the development, i focused on making a good design at first, and then, meet all the requirements.
I've made the entiry website in my native language (Portuguese, Brazil), and I hope it doesn't go against any requirements. If so, please let me know that I will redesign the site for English.
About the website:
It is a website called "Escolha seu Console", that means "Choose your Console" referring to the gaming devices of the big brands.
And on the website i tried to talk about the producers of each console, their hardware specifications, some of their games, the average price of each console and the opinion of fictional fans; as if it were a website that would guide the choice of one of the 3 consoles for future purchase.
All pages on the site have a Navbar that provide navigation between these pages.
I tried to make the whole site responsive, and adapted for mobile using the:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> presented by professor Brian Yu in class 1- HTML, CSS; and I believe I have obtained a satisfactory result.

About the Files:
index.html - The home of the website, having a stylesheet linked to it (styles_index); a navbar, a custom carousel (component obtained from Bootstrap 4); several Rows including images, buttons with links and texts; a table comparing the basic hardware of each console, and a disclaimer at the end.
styles_index.css - Stylesheet file used on the main page index.html containing 5 selectors, different CSS properties, classes and IDs. In addition to, an @media query used to make the carousel images more responsive and adapted for mobile as well.
pagina_1 - It has a navbar, a central image, a row with the unordered list on the technical specifications of the consoles in one column and the average price in the other, a grid used in the presentation of 6 console games, three columns of fictional reviews created by me (row model obtained from bootstrap 4), and finally, a simple "Disclaimer" next to the Project name.
In general, a page designed to talk specifically about the "Xbox one" console and its properties, prices, games and reviews. Personalized and responsive.
pagina_2 - Similar to pagina_1 but focused on the "Nintendo Switch" console.
pagina_3 - Similar to pagina_1 but focused on the "Playstation 4" console.
styles_pages.scss - Stylesheet file used on secondary pages of the site, containing several nestings and inheritances, in addition to many CSS properties, 3 selectors and use of various classes; to create a good personalized design.
styles_pages.map - File created automatically by SASS.
styles_pages.css - CSS file converted by SASS, linked on the 3 secondary pages of the site.

The folders contain all the image files used in their respective indicated by name.

I didn't count, but I believe I spent around 40 hours working on this project. Since it is the first real site I create, I am satisfied. It was a pleasant task, which provided me with a good experience and personal growth.

I am eagerly awaiting the return of considerations on the Project by those responsible and I am available for any necessary corrections and maintenance. Thank you very much in advance.
Sincerely,

Celso Junio Sim√µes de Oliveira  Santos
